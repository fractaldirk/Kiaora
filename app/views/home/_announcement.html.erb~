<h4>Welcome <%= current_user.user_name %></h4>
<p>Welcome to the very first version of the Blue Robin software.</p>
<p>During the first 10-14 days of May a this test version is deployed for the HR community of Greenpeace. The goal is to test the software and provide feedback.</p>
<h4>Situational feedback</h4>
<p>Feedback at the spot (e.g. running into an error) can be communicated through the ticket center "File a ticket" in the navigation bar. This ticket center is connected with the project page. Tickets will be picked up by the developer to provide solutions.</p>

<h4>Structured feedback</h4>
<p>At the end of your test run feedback is appreciated. Please cover the following topics: functional level, semantics and navigation (user-interface). Michel Renard will provide any detailed instructions. Your feedback is very much appreciated since the application will be tailored to Greenpeace's HR.</p>
<p>Thank you :-)</p>
